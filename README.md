Analysis and Implementation of a Two-Stage Op-Amp with Enhanced Stability
A two-stage operational amplifier is a commonly used analog circuit designed to achieve a high voltage gain and wide output swing. It mainly has two stages: a differential amplifier as the input stage, which provides high input impedance and the first level of voltage gain, and a common-source or common-emitter amplifier as the second stage, which further increases the overall gain. For maintaining stability, a frequency compensation capacitor (generally a Miller capacitor) is connected between the stages to control the bandwidth and phase margin.
